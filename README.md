This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

# Learning Angular

Interpolation -> when you try to interpolate a typescript property into html to display it. Should not be used while property binding
Property Binding -> when you bind a property of an html element to the value of a variable in typescript

# Bindable Properties and Events
How do you know to which Properties or Events of HTML Elements you may bind? You can basically bind to all Properties and Events - a good idea is to console.log()  the element you're interested in to see which properties and events it offers.

For events, you don't bind to onclick but only to click (=> (click)).

The MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) offers nice lists of all properties and events of the element you're interested in. Googling for YOUR_ELEMENT properties  or YOUR_ELEMENT events  should yield nice results.

For Two-Way-Binding to work, you need to enable the ngModel  directive. This is done by adding the FormsModule  to the imports[]  array in the AppModule.

You then also need to add the import from `@angular/forms`  in the `app.module.ts` file:

`import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms'`; 

# Directives
1. **Structural Directives**: Change structure of the DOM by dynamicaly inserting or removing elements from the DOM on the fly, based on conditions. eg: *ngIf directive
2. **Attribute Directives**: These change the attributes of the elements, on which they were placed. They never modify the DOM. eg: `ngStyle,ngClass`
